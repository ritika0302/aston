This add on for Property Hive adds the ability for your users to see information about schools local to properties they are browsing.

A LOCRATING SUBSCRIPTION IS REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR YOU TO USE THIS PLUGIN.

Please contact support@locrating.com to enable this service.

== Description ==

This add on for Property Hive adds the ability for your users to see information about schools local to properties they are browsing.

Once installed and activated you will automatically get a 'Local Schools' button added to the property actions of property pages. The following shortcodes are available:

[locrating_schools_map] - Display a map inline for a property. Please note that this will not display a map for a non-property page.

== Installation ==

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the Property Hive Locrating Add-on plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
